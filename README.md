# Author comments
Hello friends! My name is Yaroslav and this is my extension based on the code turtle. In this extension, the turtle draws all sorts of things. Now I will tell you a little more information about the extension.
                
**I ran a challenge**
                
I want to say that the code is not actually mine. Yes, I'm not a fool, and at the very bottom of the document I will leave links to the projects from which I copied the code. and therefore you ask the question, "What tasks are you performing?" Okay, okay, I'll answer! I set myself the task that if you see some code, then copy it to another editor. So I am copying others' tortoise based code. For me this is a test and pleasure and hard
                
Well, that's all I wanted to say. I hope there will be more information in the future
